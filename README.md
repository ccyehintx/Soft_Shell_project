# Soft_Shell_project
This project is inspired by the publication by Singh & Hernandez (2018), an extended Hard Sphere model with soft shell to consider various softness exist on a particle. This model is applicable to real systems such as metallic clusters with ligands on the surface as a full particle and its interactions with other particles. It is computationally infeasible to simulate the entire system down to the atomic scale (namely the atomistic modeling) as the quantum interactions between each atoms required extensive computing power to solve. Therefore it is this project's nature to lump the atoms or molecules into a particle with representative properties and the interactions between these identical particles will be simulated.
